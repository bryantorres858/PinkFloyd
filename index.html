         <h2 class="heading size"> About Pink Floyd </h2> 
         <p>Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. 
            They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time. Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright
            (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental 
            health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982),
            won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores.

         <h3 class="heading size"> Formation </h3> 
         <p>Roger Waters and Nick Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street.
            They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, with Noble's sister Sheilagh.
            Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard). 
            The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic.
            They performed songs by the Searchers and material written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.
            In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in London, owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent Street Polytechnic.
            Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September 1964, prompting Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the Abdabs and the Screaming Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. 
            In 1964, as Metcalfe and Noble left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens. Barrett, two years younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's house. 
            Mason said about Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd was unfashionably outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and introduce himself to me."

         <h4 class="heading size"> Present </h4>
         <p>On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd at Live 8, a benefit concert raising awareness about poverty, in Hyde Park, London. It was their first performance together in more than 24 years. The reunion was arranged by the Live 8 organiser, Bob Geldof; after Gilmour declined, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters.
            About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event.
            In March 2022 Gilmour and Mason reunited as Pink Floyd, alongside bassist Guy Pratt and keyboardist Nitin Sawhney, to record the single "Hey, Hey, Rise Up!", in support of Ukraine, following the Russian invasion.
            It features vocals by Boombox singer Andriy Khlyvnyuk, taken from an Instagram video of him singing a capella the 1914 Ukrainian anthem "Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow" in Kyiv; Gilmour described it as "a powerful moment that made me want to put it to music". Proceeds from the single, which was released on 8 April, will go to Ukrainian Humanitarian Relief.
            Gilmour said the war had inspired him to release new music as Pink Floyd as it was "vitally" important to raise awareness. Pink Floyd had already removed music from streaming services in Russia and Belarus. Their work with Waters remained, leading to speculation that Waters had blocked its removal; Gilmour said only that "I was disappointed ... Read into that what you will."

         <h5 class="heading size"> Legacy </h5>
         <p>Pink Floyd have won several awards. In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for "Best Engineered Non-Classical Album" for The Wall, and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for "Best Original Song Written for a Film" in 1983 for "Another Brick in the Wall" from The Wall film. In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" for "Marooned".
            In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010.
            Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists. David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to "Dogs" from Animals. Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen, Radiohead, Steven Wilson, Marillion, Queensrÿche, Nine Inch Nails, the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins.
            Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s.The English rock band Mostly Autumn "fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd" in their sound.
