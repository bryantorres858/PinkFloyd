        <dd>  Are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows.
             They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time. Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals),
             and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left
             in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979).
             The musical film based on The Wall, Pink Floyd The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores. </dd>

        <dd> Pink Floyd were an English rock band that became famous in the 1960s and 1970s. They performed for more than 30 years, and have sold more than 200 million (200,000,000) albums. They are famous for their live shows and deep music. Most of their albums are concept albums, which means every song is linked through a theme.
             Their first album was The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which was released in 1967. Their latest album is The Endless River, which was released in November 2014. The band were named after the blues artists Pink Anderson and Floyd Council by Syd Barrett, one of the band's founder members. In 2005, they played at a concert called Live Aid after 24 years of not playing together. The line up was David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Nick Mason and Richard Wright.</dd>
             
             <dd> They have made some very popular albums including The Dark Side of the Moon, which was released in 1973 and The Wall, which was released in 1979. After Richard Wright died in 2008, David Gilmour has said that he does not want to reunite, despite Roger saying he might want to. It is now believed that David Gilmour and Roger Waters are friends after becoming enemies for a long time. Syd Barrett started the group, and played guitar and sang in the band.
             He left soon after, at the start of 1968, because of a mental illness that was made worse by heavy drug use. The other people in the band were Roger Waters (bass guitar and vocals), David Gilmour (lead guitar and vocals), Richard Wright (keyboard and vocals), and Nick Mason (drums). David Gilmour joined the band in 1968. Roger Waters quit the band in 1985.</dd>

         <dt id="3"  class="w3-container w3-center"> What was the bands original name before Pink Floyd? </dt>
         <dd>The group rebranded in late 1965, first referring to themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound. They would later be referred to as Pink Floyd and later simply Pink Floyd. Barrett created the name on the spur of the moment when he discovered that another band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from the given names of two blues musicians whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.
             By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs and they had begun to receive paid bookings, including a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, noticed them. Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business partner and friend Andrew King became their manager.
            </dd>
         <dd>The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance to set up Blackhill Enterprises, purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £19,800 in 2021) worth of new instruments and equipment for the band. It was around this time that Jenner suggested they drop the "Sound" part of their band name, thus becoming Pink Floyd. 
             Under Jenner and King's guidance, the group became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including All Saints Hall and the Marquee. While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental excursions, and they began to expand them with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights.
             Jenner and King's social connections helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in the Sunday Times which stated: "At the launching of the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music while a series of bizarre coloured shapes flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic. </dd>

        <dt id="4"  class="w3-container w3-center"> What genre of music do they make? </dt>
        <dd> Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club).
             According to Rolling Stone: "By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suite like compositions that touched on hard rock, blues, country, folk, and electronic music.
             Released in 1968, the song "Careful with That Axe, Eugene" helped galvanize their reputation as an art rock group. Other genres attributed to the band are space rock, experimental rock, acid rock, proto-prog, experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop,
             and psychedelic rock. During the late 1960s, the press labeled Pink Floyd's music psychedelic pop, progressive pop, and progressive rock they gained a following as a psychedelic pop group. </dd>

        <dt id="5"  class="w3-container w3-center"> Where did the members of Pink Floyd meet? </dt>
        <dd> Roger Waters and Nick Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent Street. They first played music together in a group formed by fellow students Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, with Noble's sister Sheilagh.
             Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined later that year, and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright rhythm guitar (since there was rarely an available keyboard). 
             The band performed at private functions and rehearsed in a tearoom in the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and material was written by their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman. </dd>

        <dt id="6"  class="w3-container w3-center"> What is their greatest selling album ever made? </dt>
        <dd>The discography of the English rock group Pink Floyd consists of 15 studio albums, four live albums, twelve compilation albums, five box sets, three extended plays, and 27 singles.
             Formed in 1965, Pink Floyd initially earned recognition for their psychedelic or space rock music, and, as they evolved, for their progressive rock music.
             The group have sold over 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million units sold in the United States.</dd> 
            
        <dd>The band achieved worldwide commercial success with The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), which has sold more than 30 million copies and is one of the best-selling albums in the world. It has been reissued as a Quadrophonic LP and 5.1 surround sound Super Audio CD.
             The Dark Side of the Moon was followed by Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), and The Wall (1979); all except Animals reached number one in the US, and The Wall is the highest-certified multiple-disc album by the Recording Industry Association of America.
             Pink Floyd released few singles after Barrett's departure, though "Money" was a US top 20 hit, and "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2" was a number one hit in the UK and US. </dd>

        <dt id="7" class="w3-container w3-center"> What awards have Pink Floyd won? </dt>
        <dd> Pink Floyd have won several awards. In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for "Best Engineered Non-Classical Album" for The Wall, and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for "Best Original Song Written for a Film" in 1983 for "Another Brick in the Wall" from The Wall film.
             In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for "Best Rock Instrumental Performance" for "Marooned". In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award.
             They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010. </dd>

        <dd> Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract. As part of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism.
             EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club. </dd>
