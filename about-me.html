        <div class="w3-container">
          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Who am I?</b></h5>
          <p>My name is Bryan Torres I am from Dallas Texas and I am currently majoring in web devolvement.
             Two things about me one of my favorite shows are friends and I am lazy. This is also my first time ever taking a class about coding or anything related to coding. Before I had zero knowledge of coding, or what it was I’d never done anything related to coding until I started this class. So, coming in I was already learning something completely new to me, which wasn’t easy but I’ve learned so much.</p>

        <div class="w3-container">
          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>Why am i taking this/what degree am i working towards?</b></h5>
          <p> The degree I’m working towards is a web development degree while also learning an essential skill that will help me in the future. I am working to achieve this degree in order to become a UX designer or something in the field of web development. Which is also why I am taking this class as I stated earlier it was to learn a skill that could help me get a foot into coding or in the web development field.
            I am also taking this path to web development in order to expand my knowcklegde and skills.</p>

        <div class="w3-container">
          <h5 class="w3-opacity"><b>What have i laerned in this?</b></h5>
          <p> I’ve learned many things while taking this class, so much so that I sometimes can’t keep up with what I’ve learned. The first obvious thing I learned was how to make a web page using vs code, something I’ve never done before. Learning how to start an html using codes like sections, headers, articles, and many more. Although I still can’t name tags off top of my head I’m still learning and practicing.
             Practicing has helped me memorize what to add to the codes and where to put them. For example, whenever an image is added it must have the href along with the name of the file where the image is located. After doing that you’ll need to add the name of the image you are adding then you are done. 
            Just explaining this process is complicated in itself which brings me to another skill I have learned is being patient and problem-solving. For me, patience played a role in which I had to be patient whenever I had multiple mistakes or couldn’t find the solution to an error. Problem-solving was used whenever I had to find a solution for an error code, these are the things I’ve learned so far in this class.
